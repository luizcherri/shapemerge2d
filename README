Welcome to shapemerge2d!

shapemerge2d is a library to merge 2-dimensional polygons. That is, if you 
have a bunch of overlapping polygons, shapemerge2d can give you back a set
of non-overlapping polygons, covering the same area. It merges overlapping
polygons into bigger polygons.

The reason for writing this library was that there is a shortage of small,
do-one-thing-and-do-it-well open sources libraries for 2D-polygon geometry.
There is such open-source code, but it is usually a part of some bigger
library. Also, many lack unit tests, and many also lack a maintainer.

Thus, shapemerge2d was created. It is certainly not perfect, and it is
missing a lot of functionality that people are likely to want. The author
is offering it to the open-source community in the hope that it will be 
useful, and hopes that smarter minds will use it as a foundation to build a much
better library upon!

To build it, install 'scons', and then type:

In the top-level directory (where this file is).
